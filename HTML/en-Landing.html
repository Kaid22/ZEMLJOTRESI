        <h2>Mercalli earthquake scale</h2>
        <div id="Omagnitudi">
          <div id="OMnesto">
            <p>
              The Mercalli scale, also known as the Mercalli-Mili scale,
              represents one of the older ways of measuring the strength of
              earthquakes. Developed during the 19th century, this scale was
              originally based on observations and subjective experiences of
              people after the earthquake. It was later modified and expanded by
              an American engineer and seismologist Charles F. Milley.
            </p>

            <p>
              The scale consists of ten degrees, numbered from 1 to 10, pri
              where each degree describes different levels of earthquake
              intensity. This scale is specifically focused on describing the
              impact of earthquakes on human environment and objects, instead of
              measuring physical characteristics ground shaking itself.
            </p>

            <p>
              At entry levels, such as "Micro" (1) or "Minor" (2), earthquakes
              are usually imperceptible or felt by few people without causing
              damage. With increasing degrees, like "Moderate" (5) or "Strong"
              (6), the intensity of the earthquake is increasing, with the
              possibility of serious ones damage to buildings and the
              environment. The highest level, "Extreme" (10), means complete
              destruction, severe damage or collapse of all building in the
              affected area.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is important to note that, although the Mercalli scale was
              significant in past, modern approaches to seismic evaluation often
              use others methods like Earthquake Magnitude and Earthquake
              Intensity. Magnitude measures the energy released during an
              earthquake, while Intensity estimates the effects of an earthquake
              at a specific location.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, the Mercalli Scale remains part of the history of
              seismology and contributed to the understanding of the intensity
              of earthquakes, although today often combined with more modern
              methods for more precise analysis it shakes.
