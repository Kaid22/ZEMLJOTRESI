        <h2>Porject description</h2>
        <p>
          This website provides users with a quick and simple overview of the
          current catalog of earthquakes worldwide using the USGS API.
          Functionality The site provides an overview of the most recent
          earthquakes, showing the key information such as the location,
          magnitude, and time of the event. Users can quickly identify
          earthquakes that have occurred recently, with additional information
          to help understand their influence. Dynamic data updating enables
          monitoring of the situation in in real time, and the simple and clean
          design makes it easy for users review and interpretation of
          information. This site provides users with a means of informing about
          earthquakes around the world, which can be useful both for individuals
          and for researchers or those who follow geological events.

        <h2>Who made this website</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Kaid AvdiÄ‡, I was born 10.10.2003. And I am a student of
          Sofware Engineering on the State University of Novi Pazar.
        </p>
        <h2>Why was this website made?</h2>
        <p>
          This site was made as a project for the subject of Web design, where
          students got a theme and an Api they were required to use in the
          making of the website.
        </p>
        <h2>How was this website made?</h2>
        <p>
          Website was made using the HTML, CSS and Javascript technologies. For
          showing the results on the maps the
          <a href="https://leafletjs.com">leaflet.js</a> library was used, and
          for data the
          <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/"
            >USGS earthquake catalog API</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>How does this website work?</h2>
        <p>
          On the home page you can see information about the latest earthquake,
          as well as Some basic information about the Mercalli scale used for
          assessment of the strength of the earthquake, so that the user has an
          approximate picture of the power of each event. Clicking on the
          "Search" button will show you list of parameters you can set to have a
          precise control over the results that are displayed. After you have
          entered desired parameters, by clicking the "search" button you will
          be taken to results page where you can see the location of each
          seismic events on the map as well as the data available about it.
